# Hotshot Racing Random Driver & Car App!

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

Inside this fun project is a Shiny application to randomly select one of 32 cars available in the supremely awesome retro-inspired racing game [Hotshot Racing](https://www.curve-digital.com/en-us/games/featured/49/hotshot-racing)!  This is separate from the game itself, but I created the app to have some fun with my friends in the new Wimpy's World HotShot racing league :racing_car: .  Head to Martin Wimpress' [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6D0aBP5pnWTGhQAvEmhUNw) to see the past and future gaming streams, all powered by Linux!

## Installation

You can install the development version of the app as an R package wtih the following command in your R session

``` r
remotes::install_github("rpodcast/hotshots.random)
```

## Under the Hood

I was able to create this fun application in large part to these excellent packages used throughout the app, in addition to the [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) package:

* [`{slickR}`](https://yonicd.github.io/slickR/): Wrapper around the [slick] JavaScript library producing a fully interactive image carousel. Authored by [Yoni Sidi](https://twitter.com/yoniceedee), who also appeared on episode 11 of the [Shiny Developer Series](https://shinydevseries.com/post/episode-11-sidi/)
* [`{reactable}`](https://glin.github.io/reactable/): Interactive data tables for R based on the [React Table](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table) library for interactive tables. Authored by [Greg Lin](https://github.com/glin), software engineer at [RStudio](https://rstudio.com)
* [`{bslib}](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/): Create custom Bootstrap themes directly from R. Authored by RStudio software engineers [Carson Sievert](https://twitter.com/cpsievert), [Barrett Schloerke](https://twitter.com/schloerke?lang=en) (previous guest on episodes [12](https://shinydevseries.com/post/episode-12-barrett1/), [13](https://shinydevseries.com/post/episode-13-barrett2/), and [14](https://shinydevseries.com/post/episode-14-barrett3/) of the Shiny Developer Series), and RStudio CTO [Joe Cheng](https://twitter.com/jcheng?lang=en) (guest on [episode 18] of the R-Podcast).
